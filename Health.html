            <p>In 2015, Reliance Foundation partnered with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, MSD India, Tata Trusts and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to spearhead Project Alliance for Saving Mothers and Newborns (ASMAN), a first-of-its-kind in India. The project’s aim was to accelerate reduction in neonatal and maternal mortality by improving quality of care provided to mothers and newborns, from the time of admission to the time of discharge – a duration in which the risk of mortality is high.</p>
            <p>Project ASMAN used an innovative approach by leveraging multiple technology-based healthcare innovations in the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to strengthen the capacity of healthcare providers to ensure safe health outcomes for mothers and newborns.</p>
            <p>Overall the project aimed for technology enabled reduction in preventable maternal and neo natal deaths in selected health facilities across 8 districts in the two states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Over 7.5 lakhs mothers and newborns were reached through 81 government health facilities since the inception of the programme in 2015. During April 2018 to June 2021, 433,100 cases were registered and 165,000 (38%) high-risk cases were detected through the ASMAN app.</p>
            <p>ASMAN won Special Jury Mention Award under the Excellence in Social Initiative category during the annual Healthcare Excellence Awards of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in September 2020.

     <p id="hede">Health System Quality Improvement Programme in Warangal District, <br>Telangana</p>
     <P>Reliance Foundation implemented a health system quality improvement programme in Warangal district, Telangana for three years (January 2016 to December 2018). Technical support was provided to a few primary and secondary health facilities, and Mahatma Gandhi Medical Hospital at the tertiary level. At the tertiary care level, the intervention was focussed on raising standards of healthcare delivery through process standardization using NABH guidelines, capacity building of senior staff through techno-managerial trainings and facilitate promotion of electronic hospital information management system for registration of outpatients and management of inpatient records. On the other hand, at primary and secondary care level, support was provided for strengthening the facilities to implement protocols/standards and to improve the quality of healthcare during intrapartum and postpartum period for the mothers and the new-born by providing trainings to the staff nurses and doctors. At the tertiary level, through series of trainings and process documentation, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital increased their score from 1.47 to 7.38 using NABH methodology. In addition, the efforts of Reliance Foundation resulted in accessing additional resources from government to enhance the health quality systems. In primary and secondary health facilities, training on PHC management and MNH skills, has vastly improved the health services in these facilities. The assessments carried out by the programme saw significant improvement in facility and maternal & neonatal standards from 9% to 53% at the end of the project whereas the standards of Maternal and Neonatal Health improved from 15% to 75%.</P><br><br>
