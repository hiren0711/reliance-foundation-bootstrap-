        <p>The Urban Renewal initiatives of Reliance Foundation strive to enrich and improve public spaces to improve
            the quality of life and infrastructure in cities. <br><br>

            Reliance Foundation seeks to develop and modernise urban infrastructure and to create inclusive access for
            all, including the specially-abled. Through these initiatives, the aim is to transform and revive public
            spaces, some examples of which are listed below. <br><br>

            Reliance Foundation also supports programmes for the cleaning and beautification of major public places and
            city landmarks, to create new spaces for recreation and leisure. The efforts contribute to the Swachh Bharat
            Abhiyaan, through campaigns like Swachhta hi Seva, which mobilise local people to join Reliance volunteers
            in cleaning and restoring their communities. Communities also came together to clean and revive public
            spaces like Girgaum and Juhu beaches in Mumbai, Dal Lake in Srinagar, Patna Zoo, and two railway stations in
            Navi Mumbai, among other places catalysed by Reliance Foundation. <br><br>

            <span id="men">Developing modern urban infrastructure</span><br><br>

            The development of the Goda Park on the banks of the river Godavari in Nashik, in partnership with Nashik
            Municipal Corporation, included the construction of a children’s park, walkways and jogging tracks. The
            motive was to encourage cities to initiate steps for bringing phased improvements in community living.
            <br><br>

            Reliance Foundation also supported the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to set up a CSR
            (Corporate Social Responsibility) cell. The initiative enhanced MCGM’s efforts to build capacity to engage
            with corporate houses to support various civic services. <br><br>

            Near Chandigarh, Reliance Foundation constructed a unique park for specially-abled children on a six-acre
            site in Panchkula, the first of its kind in north India. The project, a collaboration between Reliance
            Foundation and the Haryana Department of Social Justice and Empowerment is uniquely designed to create a
            safer environment for specially-abled children to play, to develop their social, cognitive and sensory
            skills. Well-appointed, with areas for sensory play, solitary play and social play elements it has unique
            features like wheel chair accessible trampolines and merry-go-rounds, and disabled-friendly swings. The
            facility also has vocational trainers, speech therapists and physiotherapists on hand, to help the children
            learn and develop their skills. <br><br>

            <span id="men">Revitalising public spaces</span> <br><br>

            Helping expand Vadodara’s green spaces, Reliance Foundation developed a new park near Vadodara International
            Airport, Gujarat with a playground and other recreational infrastructure for public use. It gives people of
            Vadodara a new space for an array of recreational activities, and has greatly enhanced the quality of life
            in the neighbourhood. The project also developed a horticulture circle around the airport to beautify the
            area and to enhance travellers’ first impressions of the city of Vadodara. <br><br>

            Reliance Foundation also supported the Municipal Corporation in beautification of two lakes of Thane
            District Upvan and Masunda. The beautification effort resulted in the lakes becoming prominent places for
            leisure and physical activities. Upvan Lake is also being used by Thane Municipal Corporation for organising
            art festivals. <br><br>

            In Mumbai, Reliance Foundation worked on the development of the Mumbai Port Trust Garden to install exercise
            equipment and a footpath for the general public besides setting up state-of-the-art “She Toilets” in Navi
            Mumbai with moderated access and complete safety, security and privacy for women users.
