        <p>The entire Reliance family joined forces to strengthen and fuel the nation’s fight against COVID-19. With a 24x7, multi-pronged approach, Reliance quickly mobilised on-the-ground efforts to ensure the nation wins the battle against COVID-19 and worked relentlessly during the global coronavirus pandemic to be at the service to the people of India. Reliance leveraged all of its resources – human as well as material – to help India overcome the threat posed by the virus.</p>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which brought unprecedented health and humanitarian challenges for India and the entire world from 2020, has hit people’s health and lives hard. The entire Reliance family stepped forward to support the nation in its hour of need right from the very start of the pandemic, scaling up as the pandemic intensified.</p>
        <p>Even as the nation and the world faced the crisis Reliance took various initiatives to support the nation on urgent needs ranging from testing facilities, PPE manufacturing facilities, COVID-19 special wards for healthcare besides emergency food requirements of the most vulnerable. From healthcare to medical oxygen, from livelihood support to vaccination, at every stage the Reliance family has stepped forward to support the nation to address the needs of the hour.</p>
        <br><br><p>Reliance responded to the urgent needs of the nation on a mission mode. </p> <br><br>

        <p>roviding crucial support to the nation to meet a sudden shortage of medical oxygen for <br>COVID-19 patients, especially during the second wave, Reliance repurposed its factory in <br>Jamnagar in record time to produce liquid medical oxygen. This was ramped up to meet <br>the life-saving needs of 100,000 patients on a daily basis, delivered free of cost to various <br>states. The facility contributed to 11% of India’s total production of medical grade liquid <br>oxygen. Though Reliance was not a manufacturer of medical-grade liquid oxygen, it <br>became India’s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location in order <br>to stand with the country in its hour of need. Under the personal supervision of Shri. <br>    </p>
        </div>       

            <p>Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, the manufacturing facility at Jamnagar in Gujarat was repurposed to produce over 1,000 MT medical grade liquid oxygen and increase transportation capacities. This two-pronged approach helped ensure swift and safe supply to various states and Union Territories across India.</p>
            <p>Medical grade liquid oxygen has to be produced in liquid form at -183°C with almost 99.5% purity, which poses extraordinary challenges and risks in production and maximising tonnage. Reliance engineers worked tirelessly and through process optimisation and modifications of Cryogenic Air Separation Units, were able maximise production of medical grade liquid oxygen in a very short span of time. To ensure swift transportation, Reliance engineers made logistical modifications to rail and road transport, such as laying parallel lines, using hoses, and loading up liquid tankers through pressure differential, since liquid oxygen pumps cannot be installed at short notice. Another crucial need was transportation capacity for which Reliance airlifted 32 ISO containers and additionally augmented transportation capacity for the country in partnership with the Indian Air Force, Aramco and bp for sourcing and transportation. This helped fulfil a critical need in assured availability of medical grade liquid oxygen for the treatment of severely ill patients across the country. As part of Mission Oxygen, Reliance came together to help save lives, pulling all its facilities together for the nation</p>
