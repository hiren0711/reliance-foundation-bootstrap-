            <p>Sports For Development
                Reliance Foundation believes in sports as a medium to encourage lifelong learning, and to build
                character and leadership skills among the youth of India – our future nation builders. We believe that
                when children learn and play, communities grow and countries prosper. Besides using sports to empower
                the youth, we aim to create a platform for the champions of the future. <br>
                Besides, the Reliance Foundation Sports for Development platform nurtures sporting talent from across
                India at the grassroots stage and help them grow into high performers – through multi-pronged
                programmes, and in the process helps India set the bar high in sports. <br>
                Reliance Foundation believes in the power of collaboration to achieve the nation’s shared vision in
                sports. We forge partnerships with various sporting bodies to organise trainings and competitions, the
                development or improvement of sporting infrastructure to world-class standards and to ensure that
                budding talent have the necessary equipment to perform. The sports initiatives are free and open to all
                and have reached the remotest parts of the country, touching the lives of 2.15 crore youngsters since
                inception.</p>

                <p>Started in 2016, Reliance Foundation Youth Sports(RFYS) aims to lay a strong foundation for
                    India’s sporting future through the development of sports in schools and colleges. This is being
                    done through inter-institutional competitions at all levels, scholarships for athletes, grants
                    to institutions for sporting infrastructure as well as provisions for equipment and training of
                    coaches. Today, RFYS is a prominent scouting platform for sporting talent in the country and has
                    so far reached out to 90 lakh youth and children across 26 states and Union Territories. During
                    the pandemic, RFYS continued engaging the athletes and coaches with 44 virtual sessions on
                    variety of sport training and related topics attended by 9,500+ people.</p>

                <p>Reliance Foundation Young Champs is a football academy that runs a full-scholarship based
                    residency programme to help nurture young talent in India. It was started in 2015 and is now
                    recognised as the best residential football academy in India by the All India Football
                    Federation (AIFF). By setting up a world class platform for training, and with strong emphasis
                    on education, RFYC seeks to establish a robust pipeline of talented players for Indian football.
                    Every year talent is scouted and new players are inducted into the academy. Graduates of the
                    academy have been selected to play for professional clubs.
                    RFYC aims to be a platform where the brightest of India’s footballing talent is identified and
                    honed to a professional level. Technology is an important enabler in this pursuit. More
                    specifically, AI has proven extremely useful in helping find new talent in times of restricted
                    physical interactions and in providing players, their coaches, physios and analysts crucial
                    inputs to improve their game. The academy deployed AiSCOUT to identify talent when it was not
                    possible to organise scouting camps. <br><br>

                    AiSCOUT gauges relevant attributes of a player following trials and analyses their skills from
                    videos. This enabled RFYC to reach deeper and wider into India than ever before while overcoming
                    restrictions to talent discovery.</p>

                    performance at Olympics and other prestigious international events, and to eventually elevate
                    India’s sporting profile and enhance its engagement with the Olympic movement. <br>
                    Reliance Foundation has partnered with the Odisha Government for operation of a High Performance
                    Center for Athletics in Bhubaneswar (HPC) with the objective to produce in-house trained national

                    athletes training in athletics. <br>
                    Athletes from the HPC have already made significant strides. Amlan Borgohain won the Senior National
                    title in Men’s 200m and broke the National Record. Jyothi Yarraji had a record breaking run during
                    Europe tour where she broke the 100m Hurdles National Record thrice within 3 weeks and subsequently

                    programme and works closely with coaches, the government and sports federations.</p> <br><br>

                        Recently, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) announced a
                        long-term partnership to enable the holistic growth of Athletics in India. Reliance Foundation has been a
                        dedicated partner to AFI over the years and now the partnership is set to deepen the engagement between the
                        two organisations. <br>
            
                        Recognising the vital role sports science and medicine plays in improving sporting performance, Reliance has
                        dedicated assistance in these areas to the scholarship athletes and to the Athletics National Camps through
                        its partnership with Athletics Federation of India. <br>

                        that India is ready to become a significant player in the sporting world.</p>
