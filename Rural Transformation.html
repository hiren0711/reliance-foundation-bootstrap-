            <p>Empowering some of the most marginalised communities across rural India with innovative and sustainable
                solutions since 2010, Reliance Foundation has catalysed change across multiple levels to transform the
                lives of rural communities. Enabling them with opportunities, working through direct implementation and
                also by working in collaboration with different social impact organisations, private and government
                stakeholders, Reliance Foundation’s Rural Transformation programme reaches out across 20 states and two
                Union Territories and more than 350 districts across India. As on August 2022, the programme has reached
                over 14.6 million people.</p><br>
            <p>Under the Rural Transformation initiatives, Reliance Foundation has two core programmes, Bharat India
                Jodo (BIJ) and Reliance Foundation Information Services (RFIS). These programmes complement and
                strengthen each other. BIJ, initiated in 2010 adopts an approach of empowering communities to take
                collective action towards sustainable livelihoods through multiple pillars. By leveraging digital
                platforms, RFIS reaches partners across the length and breadth of the country, connecting rural
                communities to advisories, information and support on weather, fishing, farming, livestock rearing and
                management.</p><br>
            <p>With an integrated 360 degree approach to support Reliance Foundation builds resilient rural communities.
                This is done by focusing on the key levers that can help create positive social change, including women
                empowerment, nutrition security, climate resilience, water and ecological security, rural livelihood
                security, strengthening community structures. With this approach, positive social change has been
                fostered in rural communities, with strengthened community structures, providing water, nutrition and
                livelihood security.</p><br>
