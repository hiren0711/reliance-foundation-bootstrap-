    <p id="hede">Pursuing a career in neurosciences is Reliance Foundation UG Scholar Ananya’s dream</p> <br>
    <p>Ananya has always been curious to study the human body and keen to help the needy. Caring for people in need of medical help gives her a deep sense of satisfaction. A first-year medical student of Maulana Azad Medical college, Delhi, Ananya is one of the recipients of the Reliance Foundation Undergraduate Scholarship.
    </p>
    <img src="https://reliancefoundation.org/documents/36511/109938/Ananya.png/6b4d422a-8284-49d2-ab02-43d2e492ded7?t=1689588616521" alt="" width="100%">
    <br>
    <p>“I have been exhilarated since I got to know that I was selected for the Reliance Foundation Undergraduate Scholarship. This scholarship will help fund my education, I will use this to purchase supplies required for my medical degree. I am interested in research in the medical field and wish to pursue a career in neurosciences. I am grateful to Reliance Foundation for providing me this scholarship”, says Ananya. <br>

        Ananya’s father is an ex-serviceman from the Indian Air Force, while her mother is a home-maker. Ananya’s older brother has completed his graduation from NIT, Kurukshetra. <br>
        
        Ananya has a clear vision about her career path, she aims to enhance research capabilities in the field of neurosciences, particularly Parkinson’s disease. Her family has also been very excited about her achievement and supports her dream. <br>
        
        According to Ananya, the medical field is academically challenging, students who commit to study medicine fail to anticipate the hectic life that lies ahead of them. Ananya says, “The medical field requires a lot of sacrifices on the personal front. On the other hand, medicine is a noble profession one must not take lightly.” <br>
        
        Ananya’s message for other students who would like to apply for the Reliance Foundation Scholarships is that taking the first step towards applying is the most important and if one has courage, great things are in store! <br>
        
        The Reliance Foundation Undergraduate Scholarships are awarded on a merit-cum-means basis to students in any stream of study. This year, the diverse mix of selected scholars are from all streams including Engineering/Technology, Science, Medicine, Commerce, Arts, Business/Management, Computer Applications, Law, Education, Hospitality, Architecture and other professional degrees. <br>
        
        Reliance Foundation has awarded 5,000 scholars in 2022-23 cycle, 51% of these are girls. These scholars were selected from nearly 40,000 applicants studying at over 4,984 educational institutions through a rigorous selection process, which involved an aptitude test, Class 12 marks and other eligibility criteria. Among the selected include 99 students with disabilities as well. <br>
        
        Last December, Reliance Foundation announced it will award 50,000 scholarships over the next 10 years. Since 1996, the Dhirubhai Ambani Scholarships have been awarded to nearly 13,000 undergraduate scholars on merit-cum-means basis, of which 2,720 were people with disabilities. <br>
